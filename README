This script was originally designed to parse a mail log generated by a
combination of postfix and amavis-ng.  Later it was modified slightly to
work for postfix plus amavisd-new.

A rewrite is long overdue.  The idea really should be to track
individual connections/messages so we can tell how many messages we've
seen and what their final result was.
